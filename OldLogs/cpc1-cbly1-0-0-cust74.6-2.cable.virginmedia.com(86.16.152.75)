[01:29:15 PM]Proc: Once upon a day, you were a-walking in a forest, when you accidentally stepped on some railroads, upon which you were driven, against your will, to a cave and thrown within. Good thing you have that handy light source in your pocket.

In the middle is depicted the god Janus, as a statue, with a particularly mocking expression. Exits: NWE
