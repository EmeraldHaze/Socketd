[07:46:05 PM]Proc: Once upon a day, you were a-walking in a forest, when you accidentally stepped on some railroads, upon which you were driven, against your will, to a cave and thrown within. Good thing you have that handy light source in your pocket.
Behind you, you see not only the awesome foe that is the Rough Ground of Unwalkability, but also an Indestructible Fallen Log, which had fallen immediately after your entrance. There is no escape, but forward. Such is life, for those lacking in motivation. Exits: S

[07:47:34 PM]Proc: The tunnel goes into an ornate room, with two doors out. The one two the west posses a magnificent grandeur, whilst the one two the east seems rather flimsy and fake, although both are equally splendid. In the middle is depicted the god Janus, as a statue, with a particularly mocking expression. Exits: NWE

[07:48:26 PM]Proc: The tunnel-path opens into a large room with two exits. In the middle stands a large scale. On the west part of the scale is a viper twisted into a mobius strip, on the east side, a mongoose in a priest's robe. Both of them are alive, and while they try not to move, every so often one of them gets out of position, flickers, and returned to it's original state. Exits: WES
