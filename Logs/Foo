These one-letter commands are the ONLY ones there are. Remember to click on the text box on the bottom of the screen. There are a couple of portals, use them with T. You may die/get trapped, in which case you will be giving but one choice, to T to the starting point. So be careful out there! Note: As of version 1.2, you are unlikly to be eaten by a grue.[09:46:30 PM] Type 'c' to continue[09:47:02 PM] *--- Failure #12 ---[09:47:02 PM] Failure: [09:47:02 PM] twisted.internet.error.ProcessTerminated: A process has ended with a probable error condition: process ended with exit code 1.[09:47:02 PM] *--- End of Failure #12 ---[09:47:02 PM] Ended with errors![09:47:02 PM] Log closed.[09:47:40 PM] Log opened[09:47:41 PM] The game is very simple.
