[09:46:30 PM] Log opened[09:46:30 PM] The game is very simple. You are trapped in a dungeon. You can use N, S, E, and W to move about it, depending on where you are(Case insensitive). These one-letter commands are the ONLY ones there are. Remember to click on the text box on the bottom of the screen. There are a couple of portals, use them with T. You may die/get trapped, in which case you will be giving but one choice, to T to the starting point. So be careful out there! Note: As of version 1.2, you are unlikly to be eaten by a grue.[09:46:30 PM] Type 'c' to continue[09:47:02 PM] *--- Failure #12 ---[09:47:02 PM] Failure: [09:47:02 PM] twisted.internet.error.ProcessTerminated: A process has ended with a probable error condition: process ended with exit code 1.[09:47:02 PM] *--- End of Failure #12 ---[09:47:02 PM] Ended with errors![09:47:02 PM] Log closed.[09:47:40 PM] Log opened[09:47:41 PM] The game is very simple.

Good thing you have that handy light source in your pocket.[09:47:43 PM] Behind you, you see not only the awesome foe that is the Rough Ground of Unwalkability, but also an Indestructible Fallen Log, which had fallen immediately after your entrance. There is no escape, but forward. Such is life, for those lacking in motivation. Exits: S[09:47:43 PM] Where do you want to go?
