[10:43:34 AM]Proc: Once upon a day, you were a-walking in a forest, when you accidentally stepped on some railroads, upon which you were driven, against your will, to a cave and thrown within. Good thing you have that handy light source in your pocket.
[10:43:34 AM]Proc: Behind you, you see not only the awesome foe that is the Rough Ground of Unwalkability, but also an Indestructible Fallen Log, which had fallen immediately after your entrance. There is no escape, but forward. Such is life, for those lacking in motivation. Exits: S

[10:43:42 AM]Proc: The tunnel goes into an ornate room, with two doors out. The one two the west posses a magnificent grandeur, whilst the one two the east seems rather flimsy and fake, although both are equally splendid. In the middle is depicted the god Janus, as a statue, with a particularly mocking expression. Exits: NWE

[10:44:11 AM]Proc: The tunnel-path opens into a large room with two exits. In the middle stands a large scale. On the west part of the scale is a viper twisted into a mobius strip, on the east side, a mongoose in a priest's robe. Both of them are alive, and while they try not to move, every so often one of them gets out of position, flickers, and returned to it's original state. Exits: WES

[10:44:20 AM]Proc: Entering, you see a fabulous marble-shot room, with two ways out. In the center is a dual statue, made of marble. The northern part of it is a paladin with an upraised hammer, to the south, a fearsome lich with a bundle of something black in his hands. Exits: ENS

[10:44:21 AM]Proc: You're in the corner of an extremely military-looking hall, with tables and chairs of steel. There's a central table, with a map on it. The map is clearly of some very odd lands which you know nothing of, since you can't make heads or tails out of it. Exits: WSN
