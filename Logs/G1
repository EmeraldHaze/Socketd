The town fool, Oddball, does the reverse, whilst the puissant Staffo hits twice as hard as you stick-possesing fools.[09:02:52 PM] 0: Player, HP: 6[09:02:52 PM] 1: OtherMan, HP: 4[09:02:52 PM] 2: Oddball, HP: 5[09:02:52 PM] 3: Man, HP: 5[09:02:52 PM] 4: Staffo, HP: 5[09:02:52 PM] Target? [09:03:15 PM] Log opened[09:03:16 PM] This is QFTSOM 0.3.

User a number in range[09:03:25 PM] Where do you want to go?  [09:12:10 PM] Log opened[09:12:10 PM] The game is very simple. You are trapped in a dungeon. You can use N, S, E, and W to move about it, depending on where you are(Case insensitive). These one-letter commands are the ONLY ones there are. Remember to click on the text box on the bottom of the screen. There are a couple of portals, use them with T. You may die/get trapped, in which case you will be giving but one choice, to T to the starting point. So be careful out there! Note: As of version 1.2, you are unlikly to be eaten by a grue.[09:12:10 PM] Type 'c' to continue[09:12:17 PM] User: c[09:12:17 PM] Once upon a day, you were a-walking in a forest, when you accidentally stepped on some railroads, upon which you were driven, against your will, to a cave and thrown within. Good thing you have that handy light source in your pocket.[09:12:17 PM] Behind you, you see not only the awesome foe that is the Rough Ground of Unwalkability, but also an Indestructible Fallen Log, which had fallen immediately after your entrance. There is no escape, but forward. Such is life, for those lacking in motivation. Exits: S[09:12:17 PM] Where do you want to go?  [09:16:11 PM] Log opened[09:16:11 PM] The game is very simple.
