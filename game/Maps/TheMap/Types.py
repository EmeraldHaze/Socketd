{"BoneBranch": "This tunnel, which seems to made of bones, suddenly branches to the side.",
"OldCorner": "A very worn old corner. It's covered with dust- you must of been the first to move this air for quite a while.",
"FancyCorner": "A superbly made, although rather twisty, turn. There are marble columns and all sorts of other precious things, all of which are extremely immovable.",
"MeetHall": "You're in the corner of an extremely military-looking hall, with tables and chairs of steel. There's a central table, with a map on it. The map is clearly of some very odd lands which you know nothing of, since you can't make heads or tails out of it.",
"CrumbCorner": "You've almost twisted your ankle several times over on the very crumbly and uneven floor of this bent passage. The ceiling looks as if it's about to collapse.",
"ImageCorner": "A rather unsettling corner, due to images engraved on the walls. They are mostly abstract, but something about them chills you to the bone. ",
"WordCorner": "On the forbidding stone walls of this corner, you see lines and lines of words, in a commanding font, as if some underground god-king wrote his sacred book in the wall. It still chills you to the bone. Of course, it might be a teenage caveman's manifesto of anarchy, but it gives you the creeps all the same",
"OddWall": "As you go along this tunnel, it gets progressively darker (You ponder this for a long time, and finally realize that the fungus growing on the walls is inversly phosphorus. Lost in thoughts, you walk straight into a stone wall, although in a very odd manner. You walk about a foot into the wall, and only then you get pushed out, as if the wall rejected you.",
"IceHall": "You're in the corner of a massive room with stalactites on the ceiling. The walls are covered with a layer of frost, and you feel your lungs turn turn into blocks of ice from the cold emitting from he center of the room, where stands a magnificent throne, made of bones of all shapes and sizes",
"SharpCorner": "Going though this very awkward and sharp corner, you earn yourself several scratches from the none-too-smooth walls.",
"FancyCorner2": "An tastefully designed turn, with a very interesting color scheme.",
"EvilCorner": "This small jagged tunnel, smelling of human rot, has a dim, vile light at the other end.",
"SlimeTunnel": "You have to bend to avoid the slime on the walls of this tiny tunnel"}
